## Q21

ABCD is a rectangle, so AB and CD are the same length. In plank P there are 6 spaces between the nails, and each space is 240/8=30cm, so the length of AB is 6x30=180cm. This is also the length of CD, so the length between the nails there is 180/4=45cm. Therefore the length of plank Q is 45x6= 270, and the total length is 270+240=510.

## Q49

The area of P and Q is the same, so we can assume Q is P. The length of the square ABCD is equal to 3 of the lengths of P, so the area of ABCD is equal to the area of 9 Ps. The Ps and Q is unshaded, and since Q is P, there are 4 Ps out of 9 which are unshaded. So the fraction of the square which is shaded is 1-4/9=5/9.

## Q59

(a) We can use the amount Peili spent as one unit, so the amount she had left is 1u+7 and the amount of money she had at first is 2u+7. Since the amount of money Nurul had left is half of Peili, the amount is 1/2u+7/2, which is 1/2u+3.5. The amount Nurul spent is 2u, so the amount they had altogether is 4.5u+7+3.5, and that amount is 60. 60-7-3.5 is 4.5u, so 49.5 is 4.5u, and 1u is 49.5/4.5=11.
(b) The amount of money Nurul had at first is 2.5u+3.5. One unit is 11, so 2.5u is 2.5x11=27.5 and the amount Nurul had is 27.5+3.5=31.

## Q61

(c) Not including the first and second numbers, the even numbered structures increased by 5 as it fills up the corners and the odd numbered structures increase by 8 as it forms a new cube.The second structure is 20 rods. We can group the other structures into groups of 8 and 5. The first number is always 8, so in structure 119, there is one more 8 than 5. The first and second ones donâ€™t count, so there are 116 groups of 5 and 8. 116/2=58. 58x13=754, which is the number it increases by after structure 2. 8+20+754=774
  
## Q54

The difference between 0.9 and 1.2 is 0.3, which is 1/3 of 0.9. Therefore, for every 3 of the 1.2m string, there are four 0.9m strings as there would be three of the 0.3 differences when there are 3 of the 0.9m strings. For the four of 0.9m strings, there are 4x2=8 balloons while for the three of 1.2m strings, there are 3x5=15 balloons. The difference is 7. So the number of sets of the three of 1.2m of string is 105/7=15 and the number of balloons is 15x(8+15)=345.
